## 🚀 Some Results: 

### Case 1: Todo List items

1.Eat nutrition  
2.Listen Music  

 ✅ Todo Summary on Slack channel:  
1. Eat nutrition is to eat foods that provide the body with the nutrients it needs to stay healthy.
2. Listening to music is a form of entertainment and can also be used for relaxation or as a form of expression.  

### Case 2: Todo List items   

1. Solve leetcode problems  
2. watch movies  
3. Visiting Temple  


 ✅ Todo Summary on Slack channel:  
You've listed a variety of tasks, including watching movies, solving Leetcode problems, and visiting the Temple. It's difficult for me to infer a broader theme or purpose for these activities without more context or information.

## ✍️ Design & Architecture Decisions
- Kept code simple and minimal for clarity

- Used TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for smooth UI

- LLM used in real-time (no mocking or faking)

- Slack webhook integration for real channel comms

- Kept React logic stateful for to-do edits

- Server and frontend decoupled for easier deployment
